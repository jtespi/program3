* Fixed computation for overallScore in IglooScore2
Comparisons now use less-than-or-equal-to and greater-than-or-equal-to
  instead of just less-than and greater-than
  
* Fixed a logic issue in IglooScore2
Entering all scores as 50 would result in total score of 198.
Changed the program to set the two used scores to be 50 and 50 instead of 99 and 99.
Now the maximum score is 100.

* IglooScore1 checks for valid scores now
Prints an error message when scores are < 0 or > 50.

* Removed check for null args in IglooScore2
The check for arguments not being 3 is sufficient enough.
Arguments will almost never be null, therefore it is unneccessary code.
